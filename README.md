# C++ Learning Repository: Applied Instructor Code

This repository is dedicated to the C++ concepts and code examples I learned during my course. I've taken the instructorâ€™s sample code, applied it, and sometimes modified it to explore different programming techniques and deepen my understanding.

## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find various code samples and small projects that reflect the practical application of the C++ lessons from my instructor. Each example represents a piece of the course content that I used as a starting point for further exploration and experimentation.

## What I Learned

- **Fundamental Concepts:** C++ syntax, variables, loops, and conditional statements.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Implementation of classes, inheritance, and object usage.
- **Practical Techniques:** Working with functions, modular code, and basic debugging strategies.
- **Problem-Solving Skills:** Transforming theoretical examples into practical solutions and adapting instructor code for hands-on learning.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
